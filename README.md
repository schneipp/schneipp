**Translating the response**

Ah, looks like the user just wants a translation of the resume into English, using the same "faux over the top" style. I don’t need to overthink it — just adjust the language while keeping the style consistent. The instructions mention using citations and other advanced guidelines for a more complex query, but since this is only a translation, I can stick to meeting the user’s request and simply convert it with the required flair — no extraneous steps needed. Let me get on that.

## About Me

Hello, I’m **Ramon “Code Wizard” Schneider**, the undisputed master of bits and bytes at **NEWS-LOG AG**. If software development were an Olympic sport, I’d have a podium reserved — and I’d still find time to build three airport systems before breakfast. My trusty sidekicks: a golden-edition Kinesis keyboard and NeoVim enhanced with my custom “spell-casting” plugin. As a proud “socially integrated nerd,” I seamlessly juggle epic coding sprints and networking missions at every dev conference. 🚀
