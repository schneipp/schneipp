## About Me

Hello, I’m **Rams aka “Code Wizard”**, the undisputed master of bits and bytes at **JULITH**. 
If software development were an Olympic sport, I’d have a podium reserved. 
My sidekicks: a Kinesis keyboard, NeoVim enhanced with my custom plugin, because everything else would be a skill issue. The only tool a man needs is the command line.
As a proud “socially integrated nerd,” I seamlessly juggle epic coding challenges wherever someone is in despair.
