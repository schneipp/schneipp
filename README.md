## About Me

Hello, I’m **RAMON “Code Wizard” OTT **, the undisputed master of bits and bytes at **NEWS-LOG AG**. If software development were an Olympic sport, I’d have a podium reserved — and I’d still find time to build three airport systems before breakfast. My trusty sidekicks: a golden-edition Kinesis keyboard and NeoVim enhanced with my custom “spell-casting” plugin. As a proud “socially integrated nerd,” I seamlessly juggle epic coding sprints and networking missions at every dev conference. 🚀
