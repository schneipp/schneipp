## About Me

Hello, I’m **Ramon aka “Code Wizard”**, the undisputed master of bits and bytes at **JULITH**. 
If software development were an Olympic sport, I’d have a podium reserved — and I’d still find time to build three airport systems before breakfast. My trusty sidekicks: a golden-edition Kinesis keyboard and NeoVim enhanced with my custom plugin, because everything else would be a skill issue. As a proud “socially integrated nerd,” I seamlessly juggle epic coding challenges wherever someone is in despair. 🚀
